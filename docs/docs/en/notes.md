# Notes

!!! tip
    For guidelines on how to write and structure notes, see [Spaced Repetition Guides](resources.md#notes)

## Getting started

Tag any notes that you'd like to review as `#review`. This default tag can be changed in the [settings](user-options.md#note-settings). (You can also use multiple tags)

## Note Review Queue



## New Notes

All "new" notes are listed under `New` on the right pane (Review Queue). Like so:

## Reviewing

Open the file & review it. Once done, choose either the `Review: Easy`, `Review: Good`, or the `Review: Hard` option on the file menu (the three dots). The `Easy`, `Good`, or `Hard` depend on how well you comprehend the material being reviewed.

Alternatively, you can right click on the file and access the same options:

The note will then be scheduled appropriately:

### Faster Review

Commands to open a note for review, and making review responses are provided. You can create custom hotkeys for them in `Settings -> HotKeys`. This allows for much faster review.

### Review Settings

Available settings are:

-   Choosing whether to open a note at random or the most important note
-   Choosing whether to open the next note automatically after reviewing another

## Scheduled notes

`Review: N due` on the status bar at the bottom of the screen shows how many notes one has to review today (Today's notes + overdue notes). Clicking on that opens one of the notes for review.

Alternatively, one can use the `Open a note for review` command.

## Review Queue

-   Daily review entries are sorted by importance (PageRank)
